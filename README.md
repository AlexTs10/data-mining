Data Mining and Learning Algorithms
Project for the above course.
Open project-overview to see full project. The code is here and on colab (see overview).

## Part 1:
Using the California energy dataset do EDA (duck curve), find out energy sources outliers (Kmeans/DBscan), make a prediction model (LSTM) for the demand in a 5min interval.
## Part 2: 
Using Amazon product reviews predict their score (1-5) using a Random Forest Classifier. Data Preprocesing is also needed.
